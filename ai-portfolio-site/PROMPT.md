## âœ… Next Step:

You can now:

- Create the `PROMPT.md` in your GitHub repo
- Paste the above prompt
- Upload your `resume.pdf` to `/public/` folder
- Let **Cursor + GitHub Copilot** handle the rest with intelligent completions

### ðŸ§  Want Me to Help Scaffold the Code?

If you'd like, I can now:
- Generate your full `Hero.tsx`, `SkillRadar.tsx`, etc.
- Or provide starter code for resume parsing

Just say: **"Build this from here"** or tell me where to begin.
